Prompt #1 (Type 4):
I want to build a funny name generator
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #2 (Type 4):
in the example above is there a way for me to see or edit the list of possible "titles", "nouns" and "adjectives"? where are they currently drawn from? does the tool have access to an online dictionary?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #3 (Type 4):
I think the datamuse option might be the best, but I am not sure what options are available to select only contextually relevant words. For example if i had some specific areas I wanted to draw names/words from like old timey baseball player names, how would i do that? Or could i search datamuse for some relevant word lists and manually filter lots of my favorites to start to build a repository of funny words i want the eventual name generator to draw from? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #4 (Type 4):
i want to explore and collect words i find funny or fitting
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #5 (Type 4):
how do i run the script
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #6 (Type 4):
im not sure how to interact with it once i've saved the simple_explorer.py. where/how do i prompt it
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #7 (Type 4):
I want to build an app that when i click a button it generates a funny name. I want to 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #8 (Type 4):
I want to build a funny name generator that draws from names and words I've curaated from a variety of historic and fictional resource I will find online. Can you please create me a readme.md file that is simple and takes things one step at a time. please include in the readme: requirements, tech stack, and milestones (let's do 5). Do not do any coding yet.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #9 (Type 4):
A couple questions: I did encounter datamuse as an intertesting an potentially relevant resource for my name generator project, do you think it can or should play a role? Also in a previous attempt to start this project the initial suggestions from the AI were utilizing more python. Is sqllite superior to python for this project? I do not have experience with coding so please advise. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #10 (Type 4):
Great. Considering the revision to the tech stack and maybe factoring in my lack of coding experience can you revise the readme.md with these updates?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #11 (Type 4):
I just installed git, and it seems to have been successfully integrated into Cursor. Can you confirm and also give me an explanation  why git is helpful for a project?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #12 (Type 4):
for number 2 above, the line of code says "   git commit -m "Add initial project readme" do i simply control V the full text of the readme you provide earlier imbetween those quotations marks? or how do i actually get the readme you made "in" to the git
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #13 (Type 4):
yes please create a git guide and also let me know if my understanding is correct that to accomplish step 2 as you mentioned above, I need to paste the text of the readme you provided me between the quotation marks over   "Add initial project readme"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #14 (Type 4):
I just installed git, and it seems to have been successfully integrated into Cursor. Can you confirm and also give me an explanation  why git is helpful for a project?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #15 (Type 4):
yes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #16 (Type 4):
So for the revised Readme that you created for this project, the purpose of that is just for my reference to keep the project flow and steps organized or i should actually add the text of that readme somewhere so that cursor will use it as reference or something going forward.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #17 (Type 4):
I think my technical knowledge not adequate to make use of the git stuff. I want to proceed with the project but am still unsure if the readme is just for my reference or im supposed to upload it in the coding terminal 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #18 (Type 4):
I'd like to start compiling and storing names and words for generator to draw from, if i have identified a source what kind of format do i need it in to work well? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #19 (Type 4):
I'd like to start searching for and storing names from resources i find online. what kind of guidlines can you give me related to file type and how i should organize the data for optimal effectiveness down the road
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #20 (Type 4):
Can you write me some code to extract the text from this URL and put it into a CSV format: @https://www2.census.gov/topics/genealogy/1990surnames/dist.all.last 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #21 (Type 4):
what does this mean "pip install requests pandas"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #22 (Type 4):
help me run the installation command and let me know how i can confirm if it worked properly
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #23 (Type 4):
yes can you run the script or tell me how to do it manually?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #24 (Type 4):
I don't fully understand the git integration but I want to be responsible and use it, when i tried to "commit" i got this message: "
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #25 (Type 4):
I don't fully understand the git integration but I want to be responsible and use it, when i tried to "commit" i got this message: " can you tell me how to input my email: drewhim@gmail.com and my name: Drew Himmelreich
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #26 (Type 4):
Not yet. I want to collect more names and data before doing any name generation. I found another online resource that I need to write code to extract the names and put them in JSON and CSV files. Here is a URL. The data is not the same format as the census data, which was only surnames. this URL has both given names and surnames and sometimes nicknames instead of real given names. Not sure how best to structure this so the data will be most usable later on when we are futher along with the name generator and also I am hoping to add some algorithimic nuances that add different weighting for more common names and less common names @https://www.baseball-almanac.com/players/baseball_births.php?y=1899 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #27 (Type 4):
Can you walk me through the key elements of the code you have made above? First, i see code related to identifying nicknames, i worry that it might not be possible to identify nicknames from given names, can you tell me how the code attempts to do so? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #28 (Type 4):
So when i look specifically at the URL i shared which has data for 1899, i dont see any names with the nick name in quotations marks. Is the code able to click into the hyperlink for each name where there is more data available? For example, in the list I'm looking at for 1899, I see an entry for Dutch Ulrich. If i click onto his name it takes me to another page with more details about him, including a line item for nickname. So the code you have crafted can see both the name on the initial url page and the additinonal data on the page each name is linked to with more details? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #29 (Type 4):
before i proceed to run the new script, you mentioned i could input multiple years for the code to pull from. How would i put multiple years and also would doing so overwhelm the site as you warned about? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #30 (Type 4):
i tried to adjust the range of years in th emain terminal code to be 1845-1920, can you confirm if its input correctly and if so.... can i go ahead and run it? Actually maybe I would like to start with just 1 year. Can we do a test of just the year 1845 so i can see the actual csv output that is produced by the code? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #31 (Type 4):
how can i see the csv that was made myself? was a file created on my computer? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #32 (Type 4):
Let's go ahead and collect the other years. I want to get the data from years 1845 to 1920. Before we proceed, the CSV's i checked above only had one or two names in them, is that because we were still in the testing phase? I thought we were going to pull the full results of the year 1899 which had more names that what seemed to appear in the new csv files. is the small number of names something to do with the delays we have implemented to not overwhelm the site? Also, if we are going to do a more comprehensive pull of years 1845-1929, can we change the file names slightly so that i can easily delete the first versions of the baseball csv outputs that only have a couple names in them so that only the bigger, comprehensive versions are left in the file to keep things more organized? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #33 (Type 4):
It looks like the pull for just the year 1899 worked well. The only issue is that my folder is starting to fill up with some previous versions that had less complete data. Also, now that you were able to successfully pull the data from 1899, can you suggest how we can proceed to get the rest of the years 1845-1920. I understand that it might take some time and I'm not in a particular rush so can you advise an approach that doesnt overwlehm the site or drain to many resources? Also I want to go to bed soon, so if i ask you to start running and my computer goes into sleep mode, will you stop working? I can turn off sleep mode so you can keep pulling while i sleep. Lastly, will each year get its own csv file? i dont think its a super high priority now but I will want to consolodate some of the data into more singular sources so that all the baseball name data is in one or a few files, and then census data is simiialry in one or few files and other sources will be the same. Of course i will defer to you later on about the optimale way to organize and store the disparate data and formats to be able to utilzes properly by our name generator and teh algorithm i hope to help design for it. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #34 (Type 4):
maybe lets not delete anything yet, as long as you think it will be possible later to clean up our files and consoldate them to focus on the ones with the most robust and relevant data nd remove the ones that were from tests and have more incomplete data? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #35 (Type 4):
can we make sure i have the right panda extension installed first? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #36 (Type 4):
what is numpy
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #37 (Type 4):
how can we resolve the different installed versions issue
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #38 (Type 4):
can we pick up where we left off?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #39 (Type 4):
proceed with #1 and collect the full data set. Will you still be just grabbing 10 per year? or now you can grab the complete total
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #40 (Type 4):
I'd like to proceed with collecting in manageable batches, how do i proceed
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #41 (Type 4):
it says "run this script again to continue from where you left off." how do i do that, i want to continue
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #42 (Type 4):
can you run the script again for the next batch
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #43 (Type 4):
wait can you confirm whether we already have the data for that range?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #44 (Type 4):
as someone not familiar with coding, exactly how do i "run a script" in which part of the cursor interface do i do so? do i do in tin the terminal? Where do i actually paste teh command to get it to start running again 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #45 (Type 4):
It looks like we have successfully extracted all our baseball almanac names. I think our final dataset could already be very useful but i did notice one mistake in the output i want to trouble shoot with you. dont do any coding  yet but, if you look at the almanac page for 1920, you can see an entry for "Artie Wilson". In our current final data set, the entry for this player looks like this: {
      "full_name": "Artie\u00a0Wilson",
      "birth_date": "10-28-1920",
      "death_date": "10-31-2010",
      "debut_year": "1951",
      "final_year": "1951",
      "source": "Baseball Almanac",
      "birth_year": 1920,
      "player_url": "https://www.baseball-almanac.com/players/player.php?p=wilsoar02",
      "first_name": "Artie",
      "last_name": "Wilson",
      "nickname": "Artie or Octopus or Snoop"
    },
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #46 (Type 4):
OK we will need to fix what you mentioned where we separate out multiple nicknames from eachother but also, when i click the link to Artie Wilsons full page, you can see it lists his birthname as "Arthur Lee Wilson". It seems our current version also failed to detect the "birth name" line and use that to cross reference if the name in the initial almanac page is an actual first name or a nickname. So can you confirm if you comprehend this mistake and then let me know your suggestions for how to fix both the multiple nickname issue, and the issue where the current code assume the first name on the initial almanac page is their actual first name, without cross references it with the birth name on a player bio page. Also it might be worth while to go ahead and specifiy that I think "Birth names" will typically have 3 names: a first, middle and last name. I think we will want to ignore middle names but let me know if there are potential problems with that. Also let me know if there is some coding we can do to alert us if a name defies the first, middle last name convention so we can respond to them
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #47 (Type 4):
For 1, can you please double check if there is actually an issue with the nickname convention, it looks like it currenlty uses an OR seperator so i just want to be sure if you are right about that issue. 2 and 3 look like great solutions and I'd like to discuss how to proceed. so lets address 1 first, get confirmation. then once we are aligned i'll ask you to formally make these revisions to the code. lastly, we will need to figure out how to repair our data set. I assume we will need to run the code again on every page from 1845 to 1920 but let me know if im mistaken
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #48 (Type 4):
While your alternative to rescraping the data makes sense, I'm a little bit worried about the complexity of that solution. Let's first have you implement these 3 fixes and after that we'll discuss how to use the repaired solutions to ensure we have the correct data
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #49 (Type 4):
I want to option 1. But before we proceed I know that we had created some delays and measures to reduce the liklihood of straining the almanac website or imparing our ability to scrape the results. One was that i was manually doing only 10 years at a time or so. This time i dont want to just run 10 years at a time, I want to set the code to run and re-pull every year from 1845 to 1920. so please advise some possible tweaks to our process that would allow me to run the full year range in one go but with the ability to resume etc if there is a connection problem or issue encountered. Also, so far as we have had various versions and test versions with lots of outputs, im a bit worried about me personally and eventually our name generator being able to find the correct, final versions of name files, and ignore all the earlier, incomplete or trial versions. Please advise on naming conventinos and best practices for organizing the files for later use and navigation.

Prompt #51 (Type 4):
I thougth we had taken care of this yesterday, any idea why panda and numpy issure is recurring? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #52 (Type 4):
i see this text above "a new release of pip is available: 24.0 -> 25.0.1" do i need to take action before installing beautiful soup? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #53 (Type 4):
Can we do one initial test on just 1845 so i can look at the output before proceedwith the the remain 1846-1920?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #54 (Type 4):
stop. something is wrong
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #55 (Type 4):
stop i think there is another problem. it said there were 95 players but i only see 5 on this link: @https://www.baseball-almanac.com/players/baseball_births.php?y=1845 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #56 (Type 4):
I think we need to check again... are you able to check previous versions of the code that we used when we were doing the 10 years at a time? For example, it says bio not found for lip pike, but if i click Lip Pikes name in the table it take me to his bio page (URL here: @https://www.baseball-almanac.com/players/player.php?p=pikeli01)and can see Lip is just a nickname and his birthname is Lipman Emanuel Pike
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #57 (Type 4):
in our earlier versions of the scraper it was better able to check the initial player data and successfully cross-reference it with the bio data each name is hyperlinked to. I wonde rhwat happened between then and now
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #58 (Type 4):
let me stop you again and let's touch base
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #59 (Type 4):
Yes but before that, can you confirm that our previous version, the one that i was executing for 10 years at a time was capable of correctly identifying the table data (including player names etc) like in this URL. Then it could also extract some data from the bio page each name in that initial table links to for some further data? it is true that we have made some revisions in how the scraper records and identfiees nicknames and we added teh ability to cross reference the initial name in the year directory to their bio to compare with the Birth Name... but despite those changes im unclear how we lost the ability we had originally to look at and record the name from "the major league players who were born in XXXX" page" and also be able to cross reference with the linked bio page for each player name
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #60 (Type 4):
stop i might have an idea
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #61 (Type 4):
i saw the URL you were starting with and i just want to clarify the path that I would use to gather all the data we need. The first important URL is the "Major League Baseball Players by Year of Birth" page which has all the different available years: @https://www.baseball-almanac.com/players/baseball_births.php as you know, i am hoping to scrape all the player name data from 1845 through 1920. so clicking into the first year 1845 takes us here: @https://www.baseball-almanac.com/players/baseball_births.php?y=1845 on this page we are supposed to extract the data from the table (the only important part is really the name) and we have to then check the url that each player name in the table links to get the additional player name data (birth name, nicknames etc) this is how those bio urls work using the first player entry for Ned Cuthbert @https://www.baseball-almanac.com/players/player.php?p=cuthbne01  so again, im a little nervous because prior versions were able to navigate the year page and then in individual player bio that is hyperlinked to in each player name in the initial table... woindering if this clarifiies anything for you but also wondering what happened along the way where what was already functional got lost.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #62 (Type 4):
yes try to make those changes and lets do another test on scraping 1845 to see how it goes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #63 (Type 4):
just want to confirm that it also adds a nickname to the nickname section if the initial name on the player list does not match the birth name (i feel like you had built that logic previously but just want to confirm)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #64 (Type 4):
i need you to advise on whether you should enhance the functionality or not. If this is just a test version maybe its not necessary. but can you confirm if that logic is in the full scraper? On that note, i noticed that in the eariler final version of the data before some of our new changes, there was also frequency data related to first names, which will be helpful later on when designing the algorithm. can you also identify or confirm that element of the full version? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #65 (Type 4):
Let's go ahead and make the bio extraction changest to the full scraper
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #66 (Type 4):
so now we need to run it on years 1845-1920. You already made some revisinos so that I can execute one time and it will pull the full range  of years in one go but has some protocols in place to able to resume if there is a disruptiuon and putting in puases etc so as not to overwhelm the site? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #67 (Type 4):
stop
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #68 (Type 4):
yes you need to ensure that the code ONLY looks at names in the table, luis garcia and juan soto are names outside the table above 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #69 (Type 4):
stop
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #70 (Type 4):
1846 has 3 players listesd as you can see here: @https://www.baseball-almanac.com/players/baseball_births.php?y=1846 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #71 (Type 4):
i have a couple questions. first, how will i know when the scraper has run to completion? where can i see the progres? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #72 (Type 4):
OK im a little confused if im looking in the right place, but currently when i look in the terminal window it odesnt seem to be processing anything... so can you confirm if the process is still runing as we speak? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #73 (Type 4):
can you do a status check on the pull?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #74 (Type 4):
OK i have something im not sure you can help with. are you to keep a running tab of how many prompts/messages i send to you in this chat on this project?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #75 (Type 4):
first, yes i would like to know if the work ive done so far with you has incurred any fees or approached any limits
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #76 (Type 4):
what does the "open chat as editor" function do
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #77 (Type 4):
I found some resources online, can you review this github page and let me know how i can find these files on this pc or within cursor so that at the end of this name generator project i can Access these SQLite databases to extract your chat history
Analyze the data to count:

Number of prompts sent
Word count of your inputs
Potentially track usage metrics
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #78 (Type 4):
@https://github.com/somogyijanos/cursor-chat-export 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #79 (Type 4):
Maybe i will save that as a new project separate from "first project" where all my name generator stuff is happening 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #80 (Type 4):
Can you lay out the instructions above in a way that i can easily copy and paste into the chat when i open that new project in cursor? I think i understand step one, i will simply create a new folder on my desktop called "Vibe Coding project analysis and recap". once i have completed this "first project" (the one for name generation) then i will open cursor again, go to file, then open new folder (and i will select the new folder i made) then i will open the can t and tell me what i shouold paste in teh chat inititally to get it started folllowing instructinos you laid out above
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #81 (Type 4):
So the python script is still currently running to pull the remaining data from teh baseball almanac. I'd like to revive the work we did on the census data and some more to it and do some revisions based on all the work we ddi with the baseball data. Again, wherever possible id like remain consistent on structuring the data as much as possible to make our work easier down the road when having the generator tap these data repositiories and files we are building. since we made some changes related to separating FINAL complete data from the incomplete testing data. I want to try and repull the data from this URL and two more similar URLs but we'll need to test if our census data scraper in python is still working. here is the URL for surnames by frequency we used before. dont do any coding yet lets just touch base when you are ready  @https://www2.census.gov/topics/genealogy/1990surnames/dist.all.last 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #82 (Type 4):
Yes let's check if it is still working. And yes, id like to hear your suggestions on how to optimize our file organizations and maybe create a new file dedicated to census data and also be sure that  the final complete data sources are separate from all testing/incomplete pulls (which we should separate in archive folder)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #83 (Type 4):
i can get you the urls for both male and female first names
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #84 (Type 4):
@https://www2.census.gov/topics/genealogy/1990surnames/dist.female.first 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #85 (Type 4):
here is the male url: @https://www2.census.gov/topics/genealogy/1990surnames/dist.male.first 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #86 (Type 4):
i think that works for now for the census data. can we make sure the git is all updated with our work from today? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #87 (Type 4):
is there a problem with verifying to commits? or is it still in the process of running? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #88 (Type 4):
I honestly don't fully understand what the git is or where its stored. I have come across github before. should i be uploading th egit to github or something? would it be easier for me to see and navigate if uploaded to github
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #89 (Type 4):
?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #90 (Type 4):
i already have a github account but if you can help me create teh repository and push my code there that would be helfpul
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #91 (Type 4):
it doesnt matter if we are still workng on the project, it will be able to update over time as we progress? so for the description could i do something more general like Vibe Coded Funny Name Generator and it would still be viable cuz the baseball and census data pcs are subcate4gories under that larger project/ 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #92 (Type 4):
can you tell me more about license files and how those work with cursor? does anything i create belong to cursor or something to that effect? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #93 (Type 4):
my github username is ChumBoxBaron and the url i was provided after making new repository is: @https://github.com/ChumBoxBaron/Vibe-Coded-Name-Generator.git 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #94 (Type 4):
I notice that the readme on display on the github bage is very specific to baseball player data collection rather than being the more general readme from much earlier in our project related to making a funny name generator that utilizes various curated resources found online by me and so on. can you go through this history of the project and identify the different readmes we have created? i know some readme files might be outdated because of chages we made, but also can you hklep me understand the purpose of a readme? is there supposed to be a single readme for a project or is it viable that we would have multiple readmes? in our case so far, we started out with the idea to make a funny name generator and had some ideas about what data we would try and gather and use, but we also created brand new code specifically to scrape data from relevant online resources (census and baseball almanac) so can a project have multiple readmes or there should only be one? and if multiple readmes are permissble how is teh best way to organize them or thats already taken care of in git and/or github? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #95 (Type 4):
OK i actually saved this version of a readme you provided earlier in our project. Can you review it and make any reviisions or expansions based on the work we've done? but also, correct me if im wrong but i fee like we haven't departed yet from this original framework please let me know what you think and whether it is worthwhile to make this the overarching readme for our github and if the census and baseball oriented readme can be secondary... or if only one readme is permitted in a project? here is the original readme text: Funny Name Generator

Prompt #96 (Type 4):
Ok that sounds good and i want to proceed but ahve one more question, as we continue i may find additional data sources and maybe we will need to build new scraping codes etc, is the readme  dynamic and can be updated as we go? or it is supposed to remain static? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #97 (Type 4):
lets proceed!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #98 (Type 4):
can you check the github to see if the updated readme is present? to me it looks like the old one is still there
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #99 (Type 4):
how about this, ill paste the url so you can see how it doesn't seem to show the newer readme: @https://github.com/ChumBoxBaron/Vibe-Coded-Name-Generator 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #100 (Type 4):
if i restart my computer will i be able to pick of in our conversation where we left off? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #101 (Type 4):
i see lots of tabs from the work we have done in the area i think is called the terminal. so a tab called "collect_full_dataset.py" and others... if i have too many of those tabs at any given time can it impact performance in Cursor or on my PC more broadly? to be honest since i am outsourcing almost all the work to you i dont know how many tabs we have got at any given time and althought i have been clicking x on lots of them i also am unsure if that is doing damage or delete filies. am i correct that if i were to close cursor completey and all the tabs etc inside, i can still basically pick up where we left off by opening the "first project" folder where our work has been compiled?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #102 (Type 4):
when i try to close some tags it asks if i want to save changes... example: census-converter.py" but im pretty sure we already saved changes somewhere isnt that right? because we did a git commit at teh end of all our work yesterday? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #103 (Type 4):
ok now im a little nervous... i kind of want to start everything fresh and close all the windows and pick up work again maybe even start a new chat... i might have x'ed out a couple without clicking save... is there a way to compare what is in our git to what is in our files and makes sure they match so you can give me the go ahead that everything is matched up and i can close things? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #104 (Type 4):
Ok before we proceed can you review or recent chat activity and actions from yestreday because we tried a couple time to revise our readme to be more hollistic (about name generator rather than about the specifci baseball almaanc scraping function). even though we did a couple passes to try and update than and make sure teh github reflected those changes, when i go to the github page it stilll showx the older baseball oriented readme version. how can we do a status check to see why the github has not updated and if that is also related to things not being saved taht i thought already were based on our git commits yesterday. also advise me the difference between comitting to the git and making sure all our changes are saved locally to the disk in our first project file as i am not a coder and this whole world is quite new to me and im kind of grasping in the dark
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #105 (Type 4):
can you give me a status check? have you identified teh issue why the github is not updating with the revised readme? i saw you found the revised readme text, but you are having troubl eto lock in the revised versino on the disk or on github or both?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #106 (Type 4):
yesterday i remember said github could be stubborn about pushing changes, but even after an evening of time, when i check the github i still see the baseball version. can you check the url for our github to see if you can see the old version or if on your end you are seeing it has updated? @https://github.com/ChumBoxBaron/Vibe-Coded-Name-Generator  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt #107 (Type 4):
we talked about doing a separate project connected to tracking the word count of my prompts with you do and other conversatiuon rlated metrics when reporting about my project its length and time spent. i think you linked me to a github related to a function that could read the cursor conversration files and query against htem.
